# Sort the list of tags
#
# Does not expect any arguments, assumes the list of versions is provided in
# STDIN.
sort_tags() {
    # Sort versions by the numerical values of each field.
    #
    # By default, sort will consider the entire line and sort lines
    # alphabetically according to the current system locale, which influences
    # details like whether downcase letters come before the uppercase ones.
    #
    # First, you'll notice the environment variable `LC_ALL` is being set to
    # `C` for this command. This enables bytewise sorting, which means
    # characters will be sorted by their numerical representation in the
    # encoding table (think ASCII for US English). This makes the sorting
    # algorithm completely uniform since it disregards the user's system
    # locale.
    #
    # Then you'll notice the `-t.` option, which changes the command to split
    # lines on the provided separator `.`, instead of considering the whole
    # line, which will influence the next options.
    #
    # Finally you'll notice the `k` options, which are key definitions that
    # tell sort how we want the sorting algorithm to look at lines. Each key
    # definition will be taken into consideration in order when deciding the
    # position of a line.
    #
    # Each key definition has the following format:
    # * First it specifies the number of the field where this definition
    #   starts, according to the separation specified by `-t`.
    # * Then it specified the number of the field where this definition stops.
    #   When you want to consider a single field, both start and stop values
    #   are the same in the definition.
    # * Finally, the definitions include a single-letter ordering option, which
    #   will override the global ordering options for the current key. In this
    #   case, we use `n` to ensure the sorting is numerical.
    #
    LC_ALL=C sort -t. -k 1,1 -k 2,2n -k 3,3n
